                                                    <li>Advertising: You can display ads on your site using ad networks
                                                        such as Google AdSense. When visitors view or click the ads on

                                                        example, you can sell e-books or online courses. You can also

                                                    <li>Reviews: If your site attracts a lot of traffic, you can get

                                                    because most website analytics, like Google Analytics, only give you
                                                    aggregated and anonymized information about who's visiting. That's
                                                    because it's important to protect people's privacy and make sure
                                                    you're following data protection laws. </p>

                                                    <li>But don't worry, you can still get insights into how people are
                                                        using your site without knowing who they are. </li>
                                                    <li>With features like User Segmentation, you can group visitors
                                                        together based on things like their demographics, where they're
                                                        located, what kind of device they're using, and what kind of
                                                        traffic they're coming from. This way, you can get a better
                                                        understanding of what your audience likes and how to tailor your

                                                    <li>Another way to get insights is to analyze user flow. That means
                                                        figuring out which pages they're clicking on the most, what
                                                        buttons they're clicking on, where they're dropping off, and how
                                                        much time they're spending on each page. All of this can help

                                                <p>Ans: It is generally not possible for a website to directly identify

                                                    of the visitor. Websites can collect certain data about visitors
                                                    through various methods, however, this data is usually anonymized
                                                    and consolidated to ensure user privacy.
                                                    Commonly, websites can determine information about visitors through
